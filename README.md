# Documentation of the Snake Game using C:--

# Introduction:
Briefly introduce the Snake game and its objective.
Mention that the game will be implemented using C programming language.

# Setup and Environment:
Discuss the setup required for development, including choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor and a C compiler.
Explain how to create a new C file for the game code.

# Libraries:
List the necessary C libraries such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, conio.h (for Windows), and unistd.h (for Linux/Mac) for input/output operations, memory management, and console 
manipulation.

# Constants:
Define constants for the game, such as the size of the game board, initial snake length, and symbols for the snake and food.

# Structures:
Define structures for the snake and the food, specifying their attributes.

# Function Prototypes:
Declare function prototypes for various functionalities such as initializing the game, updating the game state, handling user input, etc.

# Game Initialization:
Describe the initializeGame function responsible for setting up the initial state of the game, including placing the snake and food on the board.

# Drawing the Board:
Explain the drawBoard function, which is used to display the game board, snake, and food on the console screen.

# Updating the Game State:
Discuss the updateGame function responsible for handling game logic such as snake movement, collision detection, and updating the score.

# Handling User Input:
Describe the handleInput function used to get user input for controlling the snake's direction.

# Main Function:
Explain the main function's role in initializing the game, handling input, updating the game state, and displaying the board in a loop until the game is over.

# Conclusion:
Summarize the key components of the Snake game implementation in C.
Encourage further exploration and customization of the game.
